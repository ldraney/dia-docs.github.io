# dia-docs
personal docs via mkdocs

built with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#edit_uri), a documentation framework that can utilize github pages, as well as the [mkdocs-material theme](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material?tab=readme-ov-file).  


Whenever you push to main branch it triggers a workflow to update the website. 

The best development flow is to clone the repo, start docker-compsoe with volumes, then vim the files and watch them update live!
